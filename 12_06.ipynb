        "####ARCHITECTURE\n",
        "Tcl/Tk consists of various modules, each serving a unique purpose and having its own separate documentation. Python's official installations include an extra module to improve the use of Tcl/Tk with Python.\n",
        "#####Tcl\n",
        "Tcl (tool Command Language) is a dynamically interpreted language similar to Python, by and large used as a scripting engine inside C programs to interface with the Tk toolkit for developing GUIs. The Tcl library gives a C interface that shall we developers create and control Tcl interpreter instances, execute Tcl instructions and scripts, and implement custom instructions in Tcl or C. each interpreter has an event queue for processing occasions and operates on a cooperative multitasking model, where obligations manipulate their own switching with out preemptive scheduling. Tkinter, a Python module, bridges the gap between Tcl's cooperative multitasking and Python's threading model, enabling seamless integration and functionality between the two. For more records on this integration, talk over with the threading model documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#####Tk\n",
        "TK is a C-primarily based package for Tcl that adds special commands for developing and dealing with graphical person interface (GUI) additives, called widgets. every Tk widget is related to a Tcl interpreter instance that has Tk constructed into it. whilst Tk widgets offer large customization alternatives, they frequently have an older, much less modern-day look. Tk relies on Tcl's event queue device to manage and respond to GUI activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "#####Ttk\n",
        "Themed Tk (Ttk) is an up to date set of widgets for Tk that offers a extra modern-day and steady appearance throughout different structures, in comparison to the traditional Tk widgets. Ttk has been part of Tk in view that version 8.five. Python accesses Ttk thru a selected module named tkinter.ttk.\n",
        "operating system Integration\n",
        "each Tk and Ttk utilize the capabilities of the underlying operating device to deal with GUI factors. On Unix/X11 systems, they use Xlib; on macOS, they use Cocoa; and on home windows, they use GDI (photographs tool Interface).\n",
        "\n",
        "#####Keyword Arguments\n",
        "When creating an instance of the Tk class, you can use several keyword arguments:\n",
        "\n",
        "screenName: A string that sets the DISPLAY environment variable, applicable only for X11 systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "baseName: Sets the name of the profile file, defaulting to the program name (sys.argv[0]).\n",
        "\n",
        "className: Specifies the name of the widget class, which is used for profile files and as the Tcl invocation name (argv0 in the interpreter).\n",
        "\n",
        "useTk: If set to True, it initializes the Tk subsystem. The tkinter.Tcl() function defaults this to False.\n",
        "\n",
        "sync: If set to True, it ensures that all X server commands are executed synchronously, which is useful for debugging on X11 systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "use: Specifies the ID of an existing window to embed the application in, instead of creating a new top-level window. The ID should be formatted similarly to the -use option for top-level widgets.\n",
        "\n",
        "#####Attributes\n",
        "tk: This attribute refers back to the Tk software item this is created while you instantiate the Tk elegance. It provides get right of entry to to the Tcl interpreter, and all widgets that are a part of the equal Tk instance share this tk attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "master: This characteristic factors to the widget that incorporates the present day widget. For the Tk instance itself, the grasp is None as it represents the principle window. despite the fact that the phrases grasp and determine are frequently used interchangeably, there is a distinction: winfo_parent() returns the name of the parent widget as a string, while master returns the real widget item. The determine/toddler terminology denotes a hierarchical relationship, at the same time as master/slave describes the containment structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "children: This characteristic is a dictionary containing the instant baby widgets of the current widget. The keys inside the dictionary are the names of the child widgets, and the values are the corresponding child widget instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "#####Modules\n",
        "Tkinter support is organized into several modules, each serving a specific purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "tkinter: The core module used for creating GUI applications with Tkinter.\n",

        "tkinter.messagebox: Provides access to standard Tk dialog boxes for displaying messages to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "tkinter.scrolledtext: A text widget that includes a built-in vertical scroll bar for easier text navigation.\n",

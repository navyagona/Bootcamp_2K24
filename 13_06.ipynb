You can download the latest version of Python for Windows by hovering over the \"downloads\" tab. The download link will take you to a 26 MB installation. The setup process can be started after the download is complete. There are many options in the setup window. The box labeled \"Add Python to PATH\" needs to be checked. This action makes sure that Python commands can be recognized on your system. The \"Customize installation\" option includes additional features such as documentation, and the IDLE development environment. Proceed with the installation by following the instructions. You will be able to manage Python packages easily once the installation is completed\n",

Go to the Downloads section and choose \"MySQL Community GPL Downloads. \" You can choose \"MySQL Installer for Windows\" and download version 8. 28, which is approximately 435 MB in size. The installer should be run once the download is finished. You will be prompted to choose the type of installation during the installation. The \"Custom installation\" option allows you to select components to install. \"MySQL Shell\", \"MySQL server\", and \"MySQL workbench\" should be included. The tools are used to manage your database. To complete the installation, follow the instructions on the screen. You'll be asked to set a root password during this process. Make sure to remember the password if you want to access the server.\n",

Right-click on \"This PC\" or \"Computer\" on your desktop or in File Explorer and select \"Properties. \" Click on \"Advanced system settings\" to open theEnvironment Variables window. The \"Path\" variable can be found in the \"System variables\" section. If you want to save the changes, add a new entry with the path to the bin directory. Command Prompt can be used to verify thatMySQL has been installed correctly. The version of the database should be returned by this command. You can enter the root password during the installation of the MySQL shell. This step shows that the installation and operation of the database is correct.\n",
